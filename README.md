# About this project

A simple command-line script written in Ruby that interacts with the API of music tracking website <a href="https://www.last.fm/home">last.fm</a>. Using the current day as a basis, it picks a random song out of all the songs a user has listened to on that day. To limit API calls, the user is asked how many years they want to go back.

A private API key is required and can be used via the dotenv gem. 

This project dates back to 2019/2020 so it still needs a bit of clean-up and finetuning. On the roadmap for the future are some proper tests, as well as a web version.
